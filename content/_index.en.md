Juliette Regimbal is a PhD student in electrical engineering at the [Shared Reality Lab](https://srl.mcgill.ca) at McGill University.
Her primary research interest is creating tools to best support audio and haptic designers.
They are also interested in language used to describe haptics, accessibility, software architecture, linked and open data, music technology, and audio-haptic experience design.
Outside of the lab, Juliette enjoys cooking, photography, good coffee, and *Star Trek*.

Her current projects are:
