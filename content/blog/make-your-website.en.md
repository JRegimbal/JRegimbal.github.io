It seems that nearly every personal website is the same. MBs of assets downloaded with little other purpose than to slow down anyone with a poor connections or an underpowered device. The result? A website that claims to be personal, but has a stale, corporate (lack of) flair that has more in common with online banking than a unique person.

It is nearly 2025: why not build a website for yourself?

Show off your projects. Discuss your interests. Design your site, both in structure and appearance, to fit how you want to present yourself. When that inevitably changes, make something new.

Modern HTML and CSS are far more powerful than they were a decade ago. Building a simple template for a site, even one that's responsive, is not as complicated as it once was. There are plenty of resources online for learning, as well. The [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/) remains a favorite of mine for all things Web.

Perhaps pick a static site generator over various Wix-like hosting services! These providers are convenient up until the point where you need a feature they don't offer. Then, taking the content you've spent time and money creating becomes an ordeal. Not so with a static site generator. Webpage content in markdown may be usable as-is; templates can be adapted to a new generator with a bit of time and effort. If you're not already in the ecosystem, you may also want to avoid [whatever is happening this week with WordPress](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/10/wordpress-vs-wp-engine-drama-explained/).

I say all of this as someone who built this website for myself years ago on Jekyll, and since then has updated the style, added a blog, and switched to Hugo for better multilingual support. I am comfortable with Web technologies, yes, but I don't spend my days building sites. This process has been powerful: I control every aspect of my site and know how everything works. No less important, it has also been fun to create my own style distinct from the e-commerce standard. 2025 is almost here, so if you don't have a website or the one you do have no longer makes you proud, perhaps try your hand at something that is 100% you and make your little corner of the web feel a bit more human.
