I try to grow a small garden with varying degrees of success. Problems come from a lack of experience to little direct sunlight to squirrels stealing my kale. I'm a vegetarian, originally for ethical reasons and now also for ecological reasons. I'm also concerned about how technology is being used to hurt people. Efficiency is important and big data has the potential for good, but there needs to be a stronger consideration of how society and especially vulnerable people are affected.

I also **really** like cats.
